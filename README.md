## Disclaimer re: "Creative Inquiry"

Let me get one thing clear first: you're taking this course with an artist, not a scientist. Shock for a computer *science* class, yes? 

I foreground this to understand the distinction about what "creative inquiry" — my term for "research" — means versus the standard term set with which you might be familiar. To invoke another surprising turn, the difference between "inquiry" and "research" isn't really a difference at all — at least in a liberal arts context.

In this summer session, we're going to do the following key components of creative inquiry:

- Ask questions to understand the general nature of a topic and discourse around it
- Adopt elements of that discourse in an effort to integrate our work into a nuanced context under the topic
- Share the result of our work publicly
- Identify our contributions as unique and valuable

As this course gets *weird* (it will), remember that these are the key rules that govern our method (there is one) and that it is consonant (i.e. the same) as what proper "research" looks like. We're simply being a bit more...facetious.

tl;dr: I make art. You will too.

## Course Description

From simulated chat participants to malicious networks, the term "bot" means many different things depending on intent and purpose. Especially during the last several global election cycles, the word has surfaced as something tantamount to the meddling of evil hackers bent on distributing so-called "fake news."

In some cases, these automated accounts are malicious. However, many bots on the internet do benign or even helpful things; some are even perpetual art installations. Whatever connotations you associate with the word "bot," this course engages with these more mainstream uses of our ability to script social media interactions. Specifically, in this course, we're going to use our superpower to identify a popular or academic conversation and contribute to it, learning more about the underlying subject in the process.

Think of what we're up to as an ongoing digital media performance — an entertainment as transparent as it is marvelous.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end our time together you will:

- begin or develop your understanding of computer programming languages, specifically Python
- interact with cloud services using application programmer interfaces (APIs)
- apply technical problem-solving skills to non-technical solutions
- discover and evaluate information
- construct independent parts of a larger program representing the product of our inquiry

## Resources

The instructor will provide all resources for this class including (but not limited to):

- readings
- technical resources such as a programming environment
- access to research resources (e.g. a library)

## Assignments

This course is comprised of the following assignment types:

- readings
- discussions
- short technical assignments
- a final, culminating project

### Readings

Readings will come from a variety of sources, mostly non-academic. These sources will be provided as items in our Google Classroom and copied to our course schedule. Readings will always be accompanied by discussion. This course implies "reading" to mean anything from a traditional scholarly article to a group of Twitter accounts to review and prepare questions and commentary for.

### Discussion

Using reading material as a point of departure, I expect discussion and general speculative provocation based on material read. Discussions will always be followed by a short assignment in which you respond to a point raised during our conversation, one which you'd like to explore further by reading into a given topic elsewhere or discussing an argument about it at length.

### Short technical assignments

Occasionally, to reinforce programming concepts or to teach new ones, I will provide short exercises. These will likely be short form assignments with sub-parts for you to complete and demonstrate functional familiarity with.

### Final project

Simply enough, your final project will be a bot. Of course, this includes several planning steps and additional work done on the way to actually _making_ what you plan to. These steps will be as integral as the product itself. As with many things in this course, there will be a few pathways to completing this assignment, adjusted to your interest and willingness to learn or exercise various levels of technical skills.

### Grading?

Where we're going, we don't need grades. But, for the sake of conducting a class:

|Assignment type | Weight | Point value |
|:---------------|:-------|:------------|
|Responses       |20%     |200          |
|Short assignments|30%     |300          |
|Final project    |30%     |300         |
|Participation    | 20%   |200          |
|                 |       |             |
|Total            |       |1000         |

### A note on Participation

You'll notice a few things about participation very early:

1. It's not discussed directly in relation to any of the assignments thus far
2. It makes up a significant amount of course points

Everything you complete in this course will have participation points attached to it. In real-world development, "showing up" (that is, being present to tackle issues and dedicating time to the practice) is an essential feature of development work. To model habits, I reward effort in ways that might seem disproportionate, but focus our work on the _process_ of completing a project. The final product is a necessary part of a good process, but learning how to engage in creative inquiry is, in some ways, massively more important than actually making something out of it.

Participation points will be added to all assignment point values throughout the course, and will change from assignment to assignment to reflect difficulty. While participation _doesn't_ necessarily include class attendance, I imagine that anyone would find it difficult to skip a large amount of classes and be able to participate meaningfully.

tl; dr: I want your work to be functional/high quality; really, though, I reward risk and effort. I want you to try things.

## A note on Platforms

We will engage with the following platforms to complete our work (see [above](#Platforms) for links):

* Google Classroom
* Google Meet
* GitHub
* JupyterHub

Each has a course-specific purpose, and using these platforms to complete our work is _required_. My hope is that using these tools will also give you a window into how professional software teams work.

## Schedule

I provide a link to the course schedule here which serves as a "living document" (i.e. it will change). As such it's, essentially, a spreadsheet. The schedule contains important links, recordings, and should be considred the central hub for finding out what we're up to do have done in the course:

* [LS 190 Schedule](http://chomp.link/ls-190-summer-2022-sched)

The above schedule will be revealed week-by-week, usually at the end of the week preceding.

## Recorded content

I will be recording all class content. This means that:

* You have the right to turn off your camera and/or audio input
* You have the ability to choose to watch recorded materials later

I ask that, if you are unable to watch or attend live sessions, you reach out to me so that we can advantage you with the resources you need for this course (including scheduling a regular office-hour check in).

These recordings are for our use only. To view them, you'll need to be logged in using your Allegheny College Google Accounts. Moreover, by remaining enrolled in this class, you agree not to share these resources with anyone outside of our course.

This provision, while it seems minor, is extremely important in making sure that our course community stays a healthy one.
